# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Using UCI HAR Dataset to create a 'tidy' data-subset

### Introduction
This repo contains the following:

*An R Script titled run_analysis.R

*A Codebook titled GCDC_HAR_Subset_CodeBook.md

*A Readme file titled GCDC_Final_Submission_README.md

### Brief Overview of the Assignment
The purpose of the assignment was to download the UCI HAR Dataset and create an R Script that would do the following:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The codebook describes the steps taken to fulfill the assignment objectives.
